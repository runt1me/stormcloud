# Stormcloud
Stormcloud is Python-based backup software which provides the ability to backup and restore files on Windows devices. Key features include:
+ Fast, secure backup of files using HTTPS
+ Runs seamlessly in background, detecting changes to files and backing them up only when necessary
+ Hold on to multiple versions of the same file

While most of our code is currently open-source, you will not be able to make requests to our API (and hence, use our services) without a valid API key. In most cases, an API key requires a paid account, but we are willing to consider issuing free API keys on a case-by-case basis for educational use; please reach out to <support@darkage.io> if this applies to you.
